Imagine having at your fingertips the ability to:

* **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Monitor your server status in real-time:** Know the uptime, resource usage such as CPU, memory, and disk to ensure optimal performance.
* **üóÇÔ∏è Transfer files without complications:** Upload and download files between your local machine and the server securely and easily, ideal for managing configurations, backups, or deployments.
* **üö™ Explore open ports:** Perform a quick scan to identify open ports on your server, a crucial step for security and diagnostics.

**BehindU** is the perfect tool for system administrators, developers, and anyone who needs to interact with Linux servers remotely and effectively.

## Main Features ‚ú®

* **Server Monitoring:**

Before running **BehindU**, make sure you have the following installed:

* **.NET 8 SDK:** You can download it from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
* **SSH access to a Linux server:** You will need the credentials (server, username, password) to connect to your Linux server.
* **Nmap installed on the server (optional for port scanning):** If you want to use the port scanning feature, ensure that `nmap` is installed on the target server. You can install it with: `sudo apt-get install nmap` (on Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install nmap` (on CentOS/RHEL).
